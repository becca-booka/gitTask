# **gitTask**
## Level_3, Task_04 - HyperionDev Software Engineer Bootcamp**
### Compulsory_Task_1

#### _**Description**_
In this task we had to create a local repositry using git and add a small python program to it. We were told to make various changes to the program and commit them. The goal of this task was to get us familiar with using git. In the intial version of the program the program had to print out "Hello World!", in the second version of the program it had to print out the message "Git is awesome!", and in the final version of the program it had to ask for the user's input and then print out whatever the user had entered.

#### _**Installation**_
In order to intall this program you will need the following:
* a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* python, you can download the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### _**Usage**_
This program is very simple and was created so I could get familiar with using git. A the moment the output it produces should be whatever the user enters. Here is a screenshot to demonstrate (I just noticed that I spelt "here" as "her"):
